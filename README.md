# NOIS - Results Complaint Management System

### DESCRIPTION

The results complaints app is called NOIS. It enables lecturers to submit results (Course work/final mark) against each course unit the students have registered for. If a student is not satisfied with their results, he or she submits a complaint, the app tracks it and then receives a CASE Tracking Number. The complaints submitted can be approved by the AR and HOD after which the results will be rectified by the lecturer depending on the courses he or she teaches.in case the complaints are not approved by the AR, a student can appeal directly to the HOD. The students can at any time also check the status of the complaint by using the CASE Tracking Number. The case status can change on submission of the case, upon approval by AR, upon approval by HOD, upon approve entry of the result by lecturer, upon approval of result by HOD and upon rejection by HOD/AR and the students receive email alerts upon each status change.

**PROJECT TITLE: RESULTS COMPLAINTS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

1. **INTRODUCTION** 

With the increasing number of students in the university, the office of the academic registrar has suffered with overwhelming numbers of students who come to make various complaints concerning their results. This has resulted into delays experienced by the students because of the few members of staff in the academic registrar’s office.

1. **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Unnecessary delays experienced by students due to the few staff members in the academic registrar’s office who are supposed to help the students rectify their problems with marks.

1. **BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM**

Different students have visited the academic registrar’s office, my friends and I personally visited the office early in the morning and as soon as we had reached the office, we had to queue for about two hours because of the overwhelming numbers that were there but as we were waiting, we thought about an idea where a student can submit their complaint online and their complaint is worked on very fast.  This led to the whole idea of the NOIS application.

1. **MAIN OBJECTIVE**

The main goal of this study is to develop a web based results complaints management application called NOIS which helps the students to submit complaints if they are not satisfied with their marks in the different course units at their time of convenience.

1. **Specific Objectives**:
- To study the existing system and define requirements for NOIS application which helps students to submit their complaints if they are not satisfied with their marks in the different course units.
- To design the model for the web-based results complaints application.
- To implement the web-based results complaints application.
- To test and validate the web-based results complaints application.

**ACRONYMS DEFINITION**

- AR-*Academic Registrar*
- HOD-*Head of Department*

5. **SCOPE OF THE STUDY**

   2. **Geographical Scope** 

This study was carried out in the various colleges of the university: COCIS, CHUSS, CEES, COBAMS where there are many students. 

2. **Theoretical Scope** 

This study entailed developing the application with multi-user views, one for the students and the other for admin which includes the lecturers, AR, HOD.


5. **RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE** 

At the end of the project, the results complaints application will be of importance in the following ways;

- Upon submission of a complaint, the application tracks it and a student is given a CASE Tracking Number.
- The submitted complaints can be approved by the AR and HOD after which the results are rectified by the lecturer depending on the courses he or she teaches.
- In case the complaints are not approved by the AR, a student can appeal directly to the HOD.
- The case status can change on submission of the case, upon approval by AR, upon approval by HOD, upon approve entry of the result by lecturer, upon approval of result by HOD and upon rejection by HOD/AR.
- Once the application is completed, the students will be sent email alerts upon each status change.
